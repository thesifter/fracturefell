# The Journey of Our Web UI Adventure: A McGuffin-Fueled Odyssey

This isn't just another **devlog**. No, it's the story of a **web UI journey**, one filled with triumphs, tragedies, and an awful lot of **McGuffin fuckery**. From the early days of blind faith to the point where we found ourselves accidentally breaking our entire project, this has been an adventure in **no IDE**, **all browser**, and **the purest of backendless chaos**.

Oh, and there was some **mystery lore** sprinkled in there as well, because why the hell not?

## The Beginnings: All Browser, No IDE

We started this project on a simple premise: a **game-inspired blog** with hexagonal grids and pentagons that screamed "quirky art experiment." No IDE. No fancy terminal. Just **all GitHub UI** and **browser-based coding**. Every line of code, every commit, and every feature was done **through the web interface**—a true **all browser** experience.

We wrote HTML, CSS, and JavaScript directly in the GitHub UI, and somehow (miraculously) managed to get something vaguely functional. There were moments when it was more about **speed** than quality, and the main thing that got us through was the **McGuffin**—the magical driving force that pushed us to keep going. But did we really know what the hell was going on? **Nope.**

### Key Takeaways from Early Days:
- **Commit often.** A small change was always a commit, even if it was just adjusting a pixel.
- **Bugs are inevitable.** But hey, who doesn't like chasing them down in a web UI?
- **Move fast. Break things.** This wasn’t a professional project, just a *weird and quirky experiment*, and breaking shit was a regular occurrence. 

## The Refactor: A Curse Wrapped in a McGuffin

At some point, we realized the CSS was a **monster**. What started as a couple of lines in a single `style.css` file grew into a behemoth of almost 200 lines. So, we made a brave decision: we **modularized** the CSS. We split it into separate files, thinking we were being **geniuses**. **Spoiler alert:** we were not.

As we refactored, we broke everything. The whole thing fell apart. **CSS wasn't linking**, **images weren't showing**, and **the zergling**... don't even get me started on the zergling. It was like trying to catch a greased-up chicken in a house made of mirrors. **We had to roll back.**

### Key Takeaways from the Refactor Fiasco:
- **Don’t refactor everything at once.** Split it up. Like a controlled burn, but smaller.
- **McGuffin fuckery isn’t enough to keep things stable.** No matter how much mystery lore you add in, **structure is key**.
- **Testing should’ve been in from the start.** But no, we decided to refactor **without a proper testing framework**. Rookie mistake.

## The Rollback: Oh, That Sweet, Sweet Stability

After discovering we had created a **bug-filled nightmare** (even worse than the zergling), we decided to **roll back** to a stable version: **v1.1.0—Lore Foundation** (but also, **don’t talk about Lore**). This rollback wasn’t just about undoing changes, it was about **finding our footing** again.

By switching branches, removing the broken CSS references, and going back to the old stable state, we **finally** got the app running again. It was like finding an oasis after wandering in the desert for weeks. **And it worked.** Stability was back.

### Key Takeaways from the Rollback:
- **Stability first, then refactor.** Always get back to a working state before adding new changes.
- **Bugs are normal, but breaking everything isn’t necessary.** Rollbacks are the best way to get out of a hole you’ve dug.
- **McGuffin-fueled development is fun, but it’s not sustainable.** You need structure, my friend.

## The State We’re In Now: Stabilized, With a Plan

We’re back at **v1.1.0**, with the system stable. There are still bugs, of course. Some minor ones (like, you know, the zergling **still looking like a pixelated chicken**), but **we’re moving forward**.

We’ve learned a lot of things in this journey:
1. **Move fast, but don’t break everything**—keep things modular, incremental.
2. **Always test** before you refactor, **not after**.
3. **Structure first**, then play with the fancy stuff.
4. **McGuffins are great**, but **no McGuffin** will save you from bad decisions.

## The Future: More Lore, More Zerglings, More Stability

While we may not be done with the zergling (we’ll never truly be done with the zergling), we’re back on track. We’ll continue to **build incrementally**, **test early**, and **document** everything we do. The goal is to **build a product with a solid foundation**, without getting lost in the McGuffin.

This **lore** isn’t just for the game—it’s for **the entire process**. So **stay tuned**, because we're only getting started. But we’ll do it right this time. No more McGuffins.

## The Takeaways:
- **Test first**: TDD is the secret sauce.
- **Modularize**: But do it carefully, in small chunks.
- **Stability**: Always get back to a stable point before refactoring.
- **McGuffin-fueled fun**: But know when to put it down.

And that’s it. The end of the beginning of our **very weird web UI adventure**.

This is a recap of the **first phase** of the project. As we continue, we will refine it further, but this document serves as a snapshot of our journey from chaos to clarity, powered by **McGuffins, chaos, and raw willpower**.
