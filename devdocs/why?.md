# The Journey of Our Project: From Chaos to Clarity

This project has been a **learning experience** on many levels, and we'd like to document the process we've gone through, the lessons we've learned, and the state we're at now.

## The Beginning: A Sprint for Simplicity

We started with the idea of a simple game-inspired blog, combining interactive elements with storytelling. The main inspiration was a **hexagon-shaped world** filled with pentagons, a fun and experimental way to visualize the interactions in the blog's design.

Our initial sprint was fast and furious, with the goal of getting something functional up and running. The idea was **"move fast and break things"**, and so we did. We built basic functionalities, got the framework down, and pushed it forward with minimal concern for structure. We simply wanted to test out the concept and get a visual of the idea as quickly as possible.

### Early Lessons:
- **Don’t rush features.** Our initial approach was to move fast, but it soon became clear that fast doesn't always mean efficient.
- **Simplicity often leads to complexity later.** Starting without enough structure made it hard to make later changes.

## The Refactor: The Struggle of Overhauling the Beast

As the project grew, so did its complexity. We faced an increasing number of **design changes**, **styling challenges**, and a **bloated CSS** that had to be reworked.

To make matters worse, the moment we began refactoring—splitting the CSS into modules and redesigning the layout—it all started to fall apart. The modularization, although theoretically a good approach, led to a **cascade of issues**. Missing references, broken styles, and inconsistencies had us in a loop of fixing things that broke things, leaving us frustrated and confused.

### Key Takeaways from the Refactor:
- **Module by module.** When refactoring, it's crucial to go step by step and not try to change everything at once.
- **Do not underestimate the impact of a seemingly small change.** A small shift in structure, like changing one line of CSS, can break things in unexpected places.
- **Testing and stability are paramount.** We realized that our approach lacked the necessary safeguards that come with **test-driven development** (TDD). It became clear that a solid **test harness** could have prevented some of the chaos.

## The Breakthrough: Rolling Back and Stabilizing

After battling with the complexities and a near-crisis of losing our working state, we made the decision to **roll back** to a **stable release**: **V1.1.0**. This rollback wasn't just about returning to a stable point, but also a chance to **rethink** our approach to refactoring and stability.

### Stability is King:
- Rolling back highlighted how crucial it is to ensure that **test-driven development** and **modularization** are introduced gradually, not all at once.
- **Taking smaller bites** instead of a giant gulp is the key to sustainable progress.

## Current State: Stability, With a Plan for the Future

We're now back at a **stable point** in the project. We've learned valuable lessons, and our project is still moving forward. The modularization of CSS remains a goal, but **we’ll take it slower**, ensuring that everything is tested and accounted for.

We've also laid the groundwork for **future improvements**, including **automated testing**, **unit tests**, and building a more **resilient framework** that will scale better as we continue adding features.

## Closing Thoughts

This experience has been a powerful reminder that **speed** is often **the enemy of stability** when it comes to coding. By slowing down, introducing **modularization incrementally**, and adopting **better testing practices**, we’ll be in a better place in the future.

The journey isn't over, but **we’re in a better place now** and looking forward to the next phase of the project, where we’ll continue to learn and grow.

### Key Actions for the Future:
- **Introduce test-driven development** early in the process to prevent regressions and complexity.
- **Modularize** components carefully, ensuring stability first.
- **Document** everything we learn and reflect on the process as we go.

This document is a part of the project's evolution, and serves as a reminder of how to approach **complexity** and **change** in a sustainable way.
