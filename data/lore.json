    "content": "**Scientific Designation:** *Therozoa serrata*\n**Common Name:** Zerg\n**Environmental Habitat:** Native to the sulfuric highland basins of Draxion Theta, characterized by superheated basalt plains, acidic rainfall, and methane-rich, low-oxygen atmospheres.\n**Core Biological Structure:** Hybrid exoskeletal-crystalline structure with chitin-silicate armor and piezoelectric lattice cores. Capable of limited self-repair via embedded nanocrystalline regrowth.\n**Blood Composition:** Cobalt-blue vanadium-rich ichor. Vanadocytes enable oxidative bursts for movement and energy conversion.\n**Metabolism:** Dual-phase metabolic system. Anaerobic glycolysis for baseline activity; chemotropic vanadate burst for rapid acceleration and combat.\n**Reproduction:** Thermophilic external budding near geothermal vents. Spore-like airborne gametocytes fertilize a resin matrix. Maturation in under 36 hours.\n**Evolutionary Traits:** Acid- and heat-resistant exoskeleton, pheromone-reactive neurology, vertical traversal via adhesive hooks. Crystalline resonance nodes may serve communication functions.\n**Hive Behavior:** No individual sapience. Displays decentralized swarm intelligence, likely mediated via semiochemicals or quantum resonance. Highly coordinated attack patterns suggest distributed cognition akin to slime molds or ant colonies.\n**Conclusion:** *Therozoa serrata* exhibits high environmental adaptability and threat potential. Swarm behavior and metabolic surges pose unique challenges to containment and observation. Further study recommended.",
